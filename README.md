# gpgen
a simple password generator that works in console

works on windows and linux, never on mac

regarding use on windows:
run the .exe in bin/Debug

regarding use on linux:
run the binary in bin/Debug, either through an already existing console or by passing the file as an argument to another console
(running the binary by clicking on it thru a GUI results in it both not booting up and somehow eating an entire CPU core. i don't know why it does this, just don't do this.)
